Standalone Application (?):
    - Which champs are best to pick based on:
        * My winrates with [champion]
        * My winrates as [champion] vs [champion]
        * My teammates winrates with [champion]
        * Overall winrate of [champion]
        * Overall winrate of [champion] vs [champion]
    Each metric will need to be weighted differently (this will be fun to theorycraft)
